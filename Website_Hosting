**Hosting:**

Hosting is the process of deploying an application or website on a server that is connected to the internet so that users can access it remotely.

During my DevOps journey I **hosted** a **static html project**, a **python django** project and a **php application** in a demo server

**STEPS FOR STATIC HOSTING PRACTICE**

  I used ubuntu server and nginx service for hosting.

First of all, download the service;
  **sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y nginx**

the next step is to start and enable the servie using command:
  **sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl enable nginx**
