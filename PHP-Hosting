This is a rough documentation of how I hosted a WordPress project in my Ubuntu VM using NGINX and PHP 8.3 FPM. 

steps:
      1: First of all I installed required packages:
          php8.3-fpm service (sudo apt install -y php8.3-fpm) → to process PHP files
          downloaded wordpress (wget donload_link)
            downloaded unzip package to unzip wordpress (sudo apt install -y unzip)
    2: now moved the wordpress file to the location /var/www/html and unzipped it ( sudo mv latest.zip /var/www/html/ and unzip latest.zip)
    3: Then I changed the sockert to port as 127.0.0.0/9000 in the location ( /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/www.conf)
        This means PHP will listen on port 9000.
    4: Restart the php8.3-fpm service (systemctl restart php8.3-fpm.service)
    5: Then I wrote the configuration file in the location /etc/nginx/conf.d/wordpress.conf as:
      
            server {
                    listen 80;
                    root /var/www/html/wordpress;
                    index index.php;
                    server_name wordpress.newexample.com;
                    location ~ \.php$ {
                        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
                        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
                        fastcgi_index index.php;
                        include fastcgi.conf;
                        }
            }

            listen 80 → server listens on port 80
            server_name → domain name of application
            root → location of WordPress files
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000 → connects NGINX to PHP-FPM

  6: Now from the windows machine open notepad hosts as;
      Open cmd as an administrator and goto C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
      open notepad hosts
      Enter your server ip and the domain name of your applicatoon
          Example: 198.168.121.11           wordpress.newexample.com

   7:  Again get back to the linux server and
        Then check if there is any error by using the command nginx -t
        If success message appears than restart the nginx service (sudo systemcl restart nginx.service)

    8: Open you web browser and enter your domain name while keeping your sever turned on. 
        You should seee a message as :

    
                            Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.
                      
                            Please check that the mysqli PHP extension is installed and enabled.
                            
                            If you are unsure what these terms mean you should probably contact your host. If you still need help you can
                            always visit the WordPress support forums.
